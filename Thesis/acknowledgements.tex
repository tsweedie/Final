\specialhead{Acknowledgment}

This thesis is a compilation of the efforts of many people that helped and
me through the years. I would first like to thank my supervisor Mehrdad Ghaziasgar and co-supervisor Regg Dodds for encouraging me during my study. Without our weekly meetings, this work would not have been possible. 
At this time I would like to extend a very special thanks to Waleed Deaney for being my mentor, without his help I would certainly not be where I am today.

%I would also like to thank the Trustees of Blanketyblank for their unwavering
%financial assistance without which my efforts would have been impossible.
