\specialhead{Abstract}

Customer service is a large revenue stream for some companies, therefore ensuring that they provide the best quality service is likely to be their main priority. Not all customers readily express their emotions, verbally, regarding the quality of the service they are provided. Mehrabian 1980, states that 55\% of communication is facial expression. The motivation for this project is to apply an Automatic Human Emotion Detection(AHED) system in cases where an employee interacts with a customer. The AHED system focuses on emotion recognition using facial expressions. The proposed method for this project, first captures an image from the camera, the image is processed using the Viola Jones Algorithm to detect the face and the Histogram of Oriented Gradients(HOG) to extract the features from the face. Lastly the AHED system is trained using Support Vector Machines(SVM), to classify each emotion. There are six universal human expressions described by Ekman and Friesen, namely Surprise, Fear, Disgust, Anger, Happiness and Sadness. Grayscale frontal images will be used as input for the AHED system.
